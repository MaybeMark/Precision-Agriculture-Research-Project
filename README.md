The code saved to this repository was used to assist in my precision agriculture research at the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center(read file titled "Research Paper" for more information about the research). 

The file titled 'Yield2' is the main file used to test different methods of optimization. 

The file titled 'SensitivityTest' was used to assist in the sensitivity analyses described in the research paper.
